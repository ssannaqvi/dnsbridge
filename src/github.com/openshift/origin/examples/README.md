OpenShift Examples
==================

This directory contains examples of using OpenShift and explaining the new concepts
available on top of Kubernetes and Docker.

* [Hello OpenShift](./hello-openshift) is a simple Hello World style application that can be used to start a simple pod
* [OpenShift Sample](./sample-app) is an end-to-end application demonstrating the full
  OpenShift v3 concept chain - images, builds, deployments, and templates.
* [Guestbook](./guestbook) takes the [Kubernetes guestbook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/guestbook) and combines it into a single **template**, which can parameterize and deploy the entire guestbook in a single call.
