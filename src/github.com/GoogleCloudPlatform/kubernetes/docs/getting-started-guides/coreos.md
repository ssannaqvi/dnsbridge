## Getting started on [CoreOS](http://coreos.com)

There are multiple guides on running Kubernetes with [CoreOS](http://coreos.com):

* [Single Node Kubernetes example in any environment](coreos/coreos_quick_start.md)
* [Multi-node cluster using cloud-config](coreos/coreos_cloud_config.md)
* [Elastic Kubernetes cluster with fleet and flannel](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-fleet-tutorial)

Warning: the following instructions are slightly stale, after setting this up, you need to also start the scheduler binary.
